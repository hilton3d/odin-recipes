write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)

The current project is a Recipes website. Upon completion of this project, I will gain
a better understanding of HTML.
